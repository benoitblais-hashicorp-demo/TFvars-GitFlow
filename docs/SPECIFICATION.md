# GitFlow with tfvars Specification

## 1. Purpose

Define implementation requirements for a Terraform repository that demonstrates GitFlow using environment-scoped tfvars files.

This specification is the source of truth for branch behavior, tfvars organization, workspace targeting, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

- GitFlow branch model with three long-lived branches.
- Environment-specific tfvars organization.
- Workspace configuration that targets one explicit tfvars file.
- Documentation and process rules that keep branch promotion predictable.

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- Platform-specific architecture decisions unrelated to tfvars workflow.
- Advanced deployment orchestration outside standard Terraform workflows.
- Secret management product comparisons or migration tracks.

## 3. Branch Model and Promotion

The repository uses these long-lived branches:

- main: production-ready state.
- dev: integration branch for active development.
- test: validation branch between dev and main.

Required promotion path:

- dev -> test -> main

Direct promotion from dev to main is not allowed unless explicitly approved by maintainers.

## 4. Environment tfvars Structure

All tfvars files must live under environment with one subfolder per environment.

Required directory pattern:

```text
environment/
  dev/
    *.tfvars
  test/
    *.tfvars
  prod/
    *.tfvars
```

Requirements:

- Keep values isolated by environment.
- Use explicit file names that describe intent.
- Keep file naming and folder naming consistent with branch intent.

## 5. Workspace Targeting Requirements

Each workspace configuration must target exactly one tfvars file path.

Example path shape:

- environment/dev/app.tfvars

Rules:

- Do not use wildcards for tfvars runtime selection.
- Do not switch target path in unrelated pull requests.
- Changes to workspace-targeted tfvars must be documented in the pull request.

## 6. Repository Conventions

Root Terraform module should use canonical filenames:

- main.tf
- variables.tf
- outputs.tf
- providers.tf
- versions.tf

Documentation files:

- docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs/SPECIFICATION.md
- AGENTS.md

## 7. Functional Requirements

### FR-1 Branch Promotion

Contributors can promote configuration changes through dev, then test, then main.

### FR-2 Environment Isolation

Each environment has its own tfvars subfolder and no cross-environment leakage.

### FR-3 Deterministic Workspace Input

Workspace execution always resolves to one explicit tfvars file path.

### FR-4 Controlled Change Scope

Pull requests should modify only the environment and branch relevant to the stated change.

## 8. Security Requirements

- Never commit secrets in tfvars files.
- Use secure workspace variables or a secret backend for credentials.
- Mark sensitive Terraform inputs with sensitive = true where applicable.
- Do not commit .terraform folders or tfstate artifacts.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- Readable and maintainable Terraform and documentation structure.
- Reproducible contributor workflow for branch promotion.
- Clear environment ownership and predictable variable resolution.

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1 Branch Policy

Documentation and process enforce dev -> test -> main as default promotion flow.

### AC-2 tfvars Layout

Environment variable files follow environment/<env>/*.tfvars pattern.

### AC-3 Workspace Targeting

Workspace configuration references one explicit tfvars path and avoids wildcard selection.

### AC-4 Security Baseline

No committed secrets in tfvars files and sensitive inputs are marked appropriately.

### AC-5 Documentation Consistency

AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and this specification describe the same GitFlow tfvars model.

## 11. Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: tfvars drift across environments.
  - Mitigation: isolate by folder and review promotions through pull requests.
- Risk: accidental promotion bypass.
  - Mitigation: enforce branch flow and branch protection where available.
- Risk: ambiguous runtime variable selection.
  - Mitigation: require one explicit workspace tfvars target path.

## 12. Change Control

Any change to this specification requires synchronized updates to:

- AGENTS.md
- docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
- Related repository documentation and workflow notes
